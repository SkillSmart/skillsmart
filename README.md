```Application Framework to make your tech freelance existence hasslefree and goTastic! Written in Typescript/React with a go backend```

Current Status: In design

Ideas so far:
- Allow users to register and maintain multiple freelance profiles across sites at ease
- Allow users to scout for suitable job offers across their registerd sites from a single interface
- Allow users to integrate their fame from all associated projects across the sites into a single profile
- Allow users to generate and upkeep a professional skill profile along their ongoing work
- Allow users to define their own job search through a customizable recommendation engine with access to posted job requests across all registered accounts
- Drive continuous self-education by customizing a recommender engine for available online courses across vendors

Mode of conduct:
- The project is developed and maintained by me
- Its an open source effort to provide a scalable starting point for a potential community to develop it as a common asset
- It builds on experiences i have had in two HR AI startups but is not related to their original ideas
- Its a toy project for me to test out some of the latest ideas in developing architectures for distributed systems and have a first integrated project using Typescript/React with Go in a productive environment

Collaboration:
- Open to all. Please start by providing recommendations to existing solutions, repos that target parts of these problems, and overall ideas towards workflow, UX and usability factors. THANK YOU!
